# ECSE420 Parallel Computing  
This repository is used for [ECSE420: Parallel Computing](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2020-2021/courses/ecse-420) provided by McGill University in Fall 2020.  

## Hardware  
All codes are developed, compiled, and tested on a [Nvidia Jetson Nano](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-nano/).

## Labs  
1. [Lab 0 - Simple CUDA Processing](./labs/lab0)   

## Get Started: The first CUDA programming example  
```bash
# reference: https://maker.pro/nvidia-jetson/tutorial/introduction-to-cuda-programming-with-jetson-nano
nvcc ./playground/playground_cuda.cu -o ./sample_cuda

# run
./sample_cuda
```

## Collaborators  
[Pengnan](https://github.com/Catosine) and [Yuhang](https://github.com/yuhang-z).
